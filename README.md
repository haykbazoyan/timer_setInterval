# Timer 

I create Timer application with following functionality:
    - Start
    - Stop (The Stop do the same what Pause)
    - Reset

In the code I used setInterval and clearIntervale functions.

### About timerMain.js & timer_V2.js file

timerMain.js is a first version, where input value does not been show in the desktop until You doesn't press Enter button.

In the timer_V2.js version I fixed that bug and add new function desktopLook, for more readability.
